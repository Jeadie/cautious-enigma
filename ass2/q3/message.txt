Directory listing may reveal hidden scripts, include files , backup source files etc which can be accessed to read sensitive information.\nX-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against \'ClickJacking\' attacks.\nWeb Browser XSS Protection is not enabled, or is disabled by the configuration of the \'X-XSS-Protection\' HTTP response header on the web server. \n\nThe secret passphrase (hashed) to their wireless network is "f28848b5e665edfcab47a9bfe5b52132".
