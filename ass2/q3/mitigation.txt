Detecting stenography is a difficult challenge because it, by definition is interested in bypassing single means of detection. To construct a single method to detect all stenography would be to disprove its existence in pixel-based methods (obviously there are other means such as semantic stenography; whereby parts/semantics of the image have a meaning only understood between communicating parties). A base method to detect pixel-based stenography is through some of the most common and well know examples such as least significant bit stenography or metadata tags. On a social media platform however, the platform has the capacity to alter uploaded content (just sneak it into the T&C somewhere). Thus scrambling these lower bits (or applying noise in some other fashion) has the possibility to eliminate any possible stenography scheme without impacting benign users.
