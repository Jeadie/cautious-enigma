A common mitigation strategy to avoid unwanted user calls (in this case, a content POST) is the use of token originating from the backend. This, either kept in the state of the frontend, or stateless via an encrypted token from a server-side key makes any requests required to pass with it this token. If an error occurs (either it doesn't pass back the correct token or it cannot be decrypted) a CSRF attack may be under attempt. A server could not perform the action and alert of this secruity possibility. In the case of the url comment, without knowing in advanced what the token would be, the POST request would not be accepted by the backend. For higher-security operations a user-involved protection should be included.
