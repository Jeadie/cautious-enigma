(a) 
An SQL injection would allow a user direct access to the DB. Given this, they could find out the corresponding table structure (via metadata tables .tables) and alter the cite in the following ways: 
  * Dump the database, losing all data about the users (We all know social media companies like Facebook just want consumer data).
  * Impersonate other users, posting at will whatever they want.  

A blind SQL injection is when a user cannot directly insert SQl queries to the database but has means to query the database in a way configurable by an attacker. For example, query parameter in a GET request often get passed straight to a SQL query (in The Flubbook, a post's ID may directly get added to the SQL statement). One can then alter these values in an attempt to inject the database. 

Client side mediation is not enough to protect against malicious inputs. A user could bypass the client's input sanitation by directly interacting with the backend itself.
